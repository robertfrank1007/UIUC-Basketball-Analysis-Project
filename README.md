<h1> UIUC Basketball Analysis Project </h1>
<h4> 11/27/23 </h4>
<h2> For this STAT 107 project, I was given free reign to analyze a data set of my choosing. I decided to use a csv file containing the University of Illinois basketball team's statistics as of November 27th, 2023. I first cleaned the data and then found averages for each significant stat. Using histograms, I was able to visualize how each individual player compared to the mean. I then looked for correlation between different statistics and conluded that 3-point percentage and point per game were not as heavily correlated as I originally thought, but that free throw percentage and assists per game have very strong positive correlation. </h2>
